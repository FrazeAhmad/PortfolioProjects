SQL project in a MySQL database for the Superstore Sales Analysis Database:

Create a database called "superstore_sales" in MySQL.

Products: stores product information such as name, category, and price
Order_items: stores details about the items in each order, including the product ID, quantity, and price
Import data into the tables using a CSV file or by manually entering the data.

9.How many orders were shipped to the state of California?
10.What is the average time between a customer's first and second order?

FROM Products
JOIN Order_items ON Products.product_id = Order_items.product_id
GROUP BY Products.product_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;



How many orders were placed in the month of January 2021?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Orders
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 1 AND YEAR(order_date) = 2021;

SELECT AVG(total_amount)
FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers WHERE loyalty_status = 'gold');


How many products are in the "electronics" category?

What is the average time between a customer's first and second order?
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, first_order_date, second_order_date))
FROM (
  SELECT c.customer_id, MIN(o.order_date) AS first_order_date,
  (SELECT MIN(order_date) FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id AND order_date > MIN(o.order_date)) AS second_order_date
  FROM Customers c
  JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
