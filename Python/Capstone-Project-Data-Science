Project Name: Sales Data Analysis

Project Description: In this project, we analyzed a dataset of sales data to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns and product performance.
We used Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore and visualize the data, and we used statistical techniques to analyze the relationships between 
different variables.

Tasks Performed:==========
Loaded the sales data into a Pandas DataFrame
Explored and summarized the data using Pandas and Numpy functions
Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations of the data
Calculated statistical measures such as the mean, median, and correlation coefficient
Grouped the data by various criteria and calculated aggregates such as the sum and average
Results:

able to answer various questions about the sales data, such as the average revenue per transaction, the highest-selling product, and the distribution of revenue by 
product category.
We also identified trends and patterns in the data, such as the relationship between the number of units sold and and sales revenue



Import the necessary libraries:=========

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Load the sales data into a Pandas DataFrame:
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')


Explore the data by printing the first few rows and some summary statistics:
print(df.head())
print(df.describe())


Use Seaborn to create a scatterplot of sales revenue versus the number of units sold:
sns.scatterplot(x='units_sold', y='revenue', data=df)
plt.show()


Use Numpy to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of units sold and sales revenue:
corr = np.corrcoef(df['units_sold'], df['revenue'])
print(f'Pearson correlation coefficient: {corr[0,1]:.2f}')


Questions to bbe asked for analysis for this data!

What is the highest-selling product in terms of units sold?
What is the relationship between the number of units sold and sales revenue?
What is the distribution of sales revenue across different product categories?
What is the average revenue per customer?


# Calculate the average revenue per transaction
avg_revenue = df['revenue'].mean()
print(f'Average revenue per transaction: ${avg_revenue:.2f}')

# Find the product with the highest number of units sold
highest_selling = df.loc[df['units_sold'].idxmax()]
print(f'Highest-selling product: {highest_selling["product_name"]}')

# Use Seaborn to create a scatterplot of units sold versus revenue
sns.scatterplot(x='units_sold', y='revenue', data=df)
plt.show()

# Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between units sold and revenue
corr = np.corrcoef(df['units_sold'], df['revenue'])
print(f'Pearson correlation coefficient: {corr[0,1]:.2f}')

# Use Seaborn to create a barplot of revenue by product category
sns.barplot(x='category', y='revenue', data=df)
plt.show()

# Group the data by customer and calculate the average revenue per customer
customer_revenue = df.groupby('customer')['revenue'].mean()
print(f'Average revenue per customer: ${customer_revenue.mean():.2f}')
